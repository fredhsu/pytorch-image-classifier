# Using streamlit with pretrained model to classify images

This example takes a model trained on CIFAR10 and uses it to classify images.
It is presented using streamlit to allow the user to upload an image and
see the prediction of the model.

The CIFAR10 training is contained in the jupyter notebook and is based on the
code example from the pytorch website.
